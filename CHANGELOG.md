# Changelog

Written for someone deciding whether to upgrade. Format and section order in
[`docs/repo/release.md`](./docs/repo/release.md).

Four numbers version independently and are recorded in every bundle: `tool_version`,
`tape_abi`, `bundle_format`, `sdk_schema` ([`docs/API.md`](./docs/API.md) §9).

## v0.1.0 — the foundation

The first named version: what the engine does, fixed in one place. Built with Rust 1.99.1 on
edition 2024; the SDK crates build on 1.85. It is not published — no
artefacts, no packages, no release tag. The first public release is v1.0.

| Number | Value |
|---|---|
| `tool_version` | `0.1.0` |
| `tape_abi` | `1` |
| `bundle_format` | `2` |
| `sdk_schema` | `1` |

Every figure below is in [`benches/baseline.toml`](./benches/baseline.toml);
[`docs/EVIDENCE.md`](./docs/EVIDENCE.md) gives the key and the command behind each.

### Runs a program deterministically

- **An unmodified Linux binary, one seed, one execution.** Time, randomness, scheduling, the network
  and the disk are drawn from the entropy tape; the same seed gives the same trace digest, and the
  digest is what "the same run" means. A five-node `raft-rs` cluster: 100 runs, 16,016 events each,
  one digest.
- **115 syscalls modelled** on x86-64. Anything else ends the run with a named error rather than
  reaching the host.
- **Threads under a drawn schedule**: uniform choice, or PCT with its probabilistic guarantee. On a
  depth-2 race PCT reaches the defect on 60 seeds of 60, uniform on 47.
- **Programs as released**: `redb` 2.6.3, `tokio` 1.53.1 and a TCP service on it, `libmdbx` through
  its Rust binding, and a 103 MB Ethereum execution client through 333,485 events of its node
  command.

### A cluster in one world

- Per-node clocks with drawn offset and drift, per-node filesystems and futex spaces.
- A virtual network that drops, duplicates, reorders, delays and partitions.
- A virtual disk with strict `fsync` semantics, torn writes, stalls, full and failing devices, and
  crash snapshots.
- Node lifecycle as a fault: kill, freeze, thaw, restart, restart from an older synced image, and a
  reorg that rewinds a cluster to a common ancestor.
- A prepared filesystem as a run input, recorded in the bundle by digest and checked before replay.

### Judges a run

- Crashes, hangs and deadlocks, with no annotation at all.
- SDKs in Rust, Python, C# and Go, held to one conformance suite; a C runtime fills the coverage map
  for any program built with sanitizer coverage. `always` is judged per run;
  `sometimes` and `reachable` per campaign, and a property nothing satisfied is reported as a result.
- A guest that says nothing about itself: a run horizon, so a server that never exits is judged; a
  cluster that healed and committed nothing; an answer given before it was durable and lost on
  restart. Against `redb` 2.6.3: 200 runs, 330 crashes, 12,594 acknowledgements verified of 12,594.
- Differential testing: one tape, several implementations of one specification, a finding where
  their output differs.

### Searches, reproduces, shrinks

- **Campaigns**: a corpus, coverage-guided mutation of the tape and drawn fault schedules. A
  campaign is a pure function of its master seed; 131,000 runs per hour against `redb`.
- **`.bohr` bundles and `bohr replay`**: a run reproduces on another machine or is refused with the
  reason named. 9 of 9 bundles written by a Windows build replayed on Linux.
- **`bohr reduce`**: delta debugging over configuration, delivered events and tape, under a replay
  budget. A fixture's 49,477 events reduced to 18 in 20 replays.
- **`bohr report`**: one static HTML file — the point of violation, a timeline per node, the faults
  that fired, the draws that mattered; `--redact` rewrites the bundle so it still replays.
- **`bohr replay --break-at` and `--gdb`**: a reproduced run stopped at a named event and handed to
  an ordinary debugger.
- `bohr trace` (text or JSON Lines), `bohr note`, `bohr survey` (every unmodelled syscall a program
  asks for, in one pass), `bohr doctor` (what this host can and cannot do).

### Found

- Two defects in widely deployed open-source projects, reproduced by bundle on every seed and held
  with their maintainers until fixed.

### What it does not do

- **Run outside Linux x86-64.** The core builds and tests on macOS and Windows; the program under
  test needs Linux, kernel 5.4 or newer.
- **Model `io_uring`, or any syscall outside the 115.** Such a program stops at the first unmodelled
  call, by design.
- **Inject every catalogued fault.** Disk write reordering, a clock step and a change of drift
  during a run are named in the fault catalogue and never fired; clocks are skewed once, before the
  run begins.
- **Place faults better than chance.** Guided targeting loses to uniform on the defect it was
  measured against, and the claim is withdrawn ([`docs/API.md`](./docs/API.md) §5.4).
- **Shrink a real client's run within a small budget.** 20 replays took 1,222,888 events to
  1,189,704.
- **Hold to ≤ 5× native everywhere.** 3.6× on `redb`'s test suite, measured outside the tree; 6.6×
  on the same database under the Windows subsystem for Linux.
- **Contain a hostile program.** Bohr is not a security sandbox. `RDRAND` is a documented hole in
  determinism ([`docs/DETERMINISM.md`](./docs/DETERMINISM.md)).

Nothing here is stable: the tape ABI, the bundle format and the command line change before v1.0,
and every change that breaks a stored bundle bumps the number that says so.
